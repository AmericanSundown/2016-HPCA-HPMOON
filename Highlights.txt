A study on methods to overlap the search space in distributed multi-objective evolutionary algorithms is carried out
A new adaptive overlapping mechanism is presented
Different combinations of number of islands, genome sizes, benchmarks and methods are used, comparing different quality metrics
Results are validated in a real system
All overlapping schemes outperform the baseline, being the adaptive method the one that obtains the best performance
